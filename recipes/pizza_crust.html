    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Water -- 1 to 1.5 cupss at 100 - 110 F</li>
        <li>Active Dry or Instant Yeast -- 1tbsp</li>
        <li>Honey -- 1tbsp </li>
        <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil -- 2tbsp</li>
        <li>Salt -- 1tsp</li>
        <li>Whole Wheat Flower -- 3.25 cups</li>
        <li>Corn Meal-- Sprinkle</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the warm water, yeast, and honey together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a doug hook attachment.
            Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes or until foamy on top. 
        </li>
        <li>Add the olive oil, salt, and flouyr. Beat on low speed for 3 minutes. turn the dough out onto a lightly floured sufface. It will be slightly tacky to the touch. With lightly floured hands, knead the dough for 5 minuites. The dough can be a littel too heavy for a micer to knead it,
            but you can certainly use the mixer on low speed if needed instead. After kneading, the dough should still feel a littel soft. Poke it with your finger - if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise.I
        </li>
        <li>Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil or nonstick spray-just use the same bowl you used for the dough. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 2 hours or until double in size. </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 475F. Allow it to heat for at least 15-20 minutes as you shape the pizza. Lightly grease baking sheet or pizza pan with nonstick spray or olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal, which gives the crust extra crunch and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Dough</strong> When the dough is ready, punch it down to realease any air bubbles. Divide the dough in half.    On a lightly floured work surface using lightly floured hands or rolling pin, gently flatten the dough into a disc. Place o nprepared pan and, using lightly floured hands, stretch and flatten the disc into 12-inch circle.
        Lift the edge of the dough up to create a lip around the edges.</li>
        <li>Cover dough lightly with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow to rest for a few minutes as you prepare your pizza toppings.</li>
        <li>To prevent the filling from making your pizza crust soggy, brush the top lightly with olive oil. Using your figners, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Top with your favorite toppings and bake for 15-16 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice hot pizza and serve immediately. Store leftover pizza covered tightly in teh refrigerator and reheat as you prefer. </li>
